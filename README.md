# Roomate-Roundup

Roommate Match Project

Idea: Our project envisions the creation of a unique application dedicated to pairing individuals seeking roommates. It distinguishes itself with a swipe-style matchmaking system for finding compatible living partners. The platform will support various user roles, including an administrator, general users, and premium users who prefer enhanced features through a subscription. Essential functionalities of the app include sophisticated matching algorithms based on personal preferences and geographical location, coupled with a messaging feature to enable seamless communication among users.
